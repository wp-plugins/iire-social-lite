== Frequently Asked Questions ==
Q. Is there any cost associated with this plugin?
A. No! This plugin is completely free to use on as many sites as you want!

Q. What are the plugin requirements?
A. The admin section requires Jquery and Jquery UI to be enabled. These libraries will be loaded from the Google CDN if not present, then initialized on the widget and shortcode admin pages.

Q. Why two different admin panels for the widget and the shortcode?
A. All settings for the widget and the shortcode are stored independently. The widget(best used in the sidebar) and the shortcode(best used on a page or post) can be designed differently, with different themes, size, icon order, etc.

Q. How were the icons created?
A. All icons were designed in-house at iiRe Productions using high-resolution vector images. This method helps us to produce the highest quality images.

Q. Can I add additional icons?
A. There is a "blank" icon that is a placeholder for one additional network. If you have experience editing graphics, you can add a symbol for another network or link to the icon in your selected theme. If you need addtional networks, please see our full version of this plugin <a href="http://iireproductions.com/web/website-development/wordpress-plugins/plugins-social-icons/">iiRe Social Icons</a> for more information.

Q. How do I change the default links for each icon?
A. In the Widget or Shortcode Designer, just double-click the desired icon to display the title/link icon and enter the appropriate values.
