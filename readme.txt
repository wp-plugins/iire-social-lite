== Frequently Asked Questions ==
**Q. Is there any cost associated with this plugin?**
A. No! This plugin is completely free to use on as many sites as you want!

**Q. What are the plugin requirements?**
A. The admin section requires Jquery and Jquery UI to be enabled.  These are usually included with your default Wordpress installation.

**Q. Why two different admin panels for the widget and the shortcode?**
A. All settings for the widget and the shortcode are stored independently. The widget(best used in the sidebar) and the shortcode(best used on a page or post) can be designed differently, with different themes, size, icon order, etc.

**Q. How were the icons created?**
A. All icons were designed in-house at iiRe Productions using high-resolution vector images. This method helps us to produce the highest quality images.

**Q. Can I add additional icons?**
A. There is a "blank" icon that is a placeholder for one additional network. If you have experience editing graphics, you can add a symbol for another network or link to the icon in your selected theme. If you need addtional networks, please see our full version of this plugin <a href="http://iireproductions.com/web/website-development/wordpress-plugins/plugins-social-icons/">iiRe Social Icons</a> for more information.

**Q. How do I change the default links for each icon?**
